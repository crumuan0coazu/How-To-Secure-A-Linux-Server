## What is Sonarworks Reference 4 Studio Edition v4.4.0?
  
Sonarworks Reference 4 Studio Edition v4.4.0 is the latest version of the popular audio calibration software from Sonarworks, a company that specializes in acoustic measurement and correction solutions. The software aims to help audio professionals and enthusiasts achieve a flat frequency response from their speakers and headphones, regardless of the room acoustics or the device model.
  
By using a calibrated measurement microphone and following a step-by-step guide, you can create a custom profile for your speakers or headphones that compensates for their frequency response deviations and phase issues. You can then apply this profile to your audio output using either a system-wide app or a DAW plugin that supports AU, AAX Native, RTAS, and VST formats.
  
The software also allows you to see your actual frequency response before and after the correction, as well as compare your left and right channel response individually. You can also choose from various target curves, such as flat, custom, or predefined presets for different genres and applications.
